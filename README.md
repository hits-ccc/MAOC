This repository offers some insight into the code behind the Matrix of Orthogonalized Atomic Orbital Coeffients, a novel molecular representation that can be used to distinguish compounds with various charge and spin multiplicities. 
Furthermore, the article this github supports introduces two new chemical datasets, N-HPC-1, REDOX, and a variation of the QM7b dataset known as QM7b(X), which are also explained in this repository.
